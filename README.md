## Fundbox Frontend Assignment

We've provided designs (PSD, Sketch, and exports) for an interface that plays music from an API placeholder.
Please write a Single Page Application using the framework of your choice, and split functionality into components where you find it makes sense to.

API URL : https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/fbx-fed-homework/fed_home_assignment_api.json

The app should include the following functionality:

1. Play/Pause
2. Next/Prev Song
3. Track Art
4. Artist Name
5. Song Name  
6. Current track progress bar

Icon images are provided in the `Assets/` folder, and the `font-family` for the app is Helvetica.

Please open a public repo on Github with the assignment code.
Create an "initial" commit without code when you begin.
Create a "done" commit to timestamp when you have finished.
Provide a clear README as to how to run your app (webpack, node server... up to you)
When you're done, please reply with a link to the github repo.

Good luck!
